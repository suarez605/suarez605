### Hi there 👋
👨‍💻
I am Álvaro Suárez, a Software Engineer from Madrid, Spain. I am mainly a Backend developer in languages such as java and Python but I am also interested in many more things like Cybersecurity, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.
I am also a self-taught photographer and I really like the intelligence world in fields like SIGINT, HUMINT and IMINT.

- 🔭 I am a ETSIINF UPM Student. Also doing some work as a freelance software engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FastAPI and Automated Cripto Trading, also learning about Cyberintelligence.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on free software projects or any disruptive idea to build a startup.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to Computer Science or about any subject from the Computer Engineering Degree at ETSIINF.
